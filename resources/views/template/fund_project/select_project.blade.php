                <p class="text-light">
                    On January 1, 2020, the Pakistan Navy Engineering College NUST (PNEC NUST) in Karachi proudly inaugurated the new Begum Yusuf H. Shirazi Girls Hostel. This project was made possible through the generous philanthropic support of the Atlas Foundation. The newly completed block, designed to accommodate 72 female students, spans three floors, each featuring eight rooms.
                </p>
                <p class="text-light">
                    Additionally, the Atlas Foundation funded the renovation and uplift of the old hostel building at a cost of approximately PKR 5.4 million. This comprehensive upgrade included the expansion of the dining hall, the construction of a new kitchen, and roof treatment.
                </p>
                <p class="text-light"> This initiative stands as a testament to the significant impact that philanthropic contributions can make in enhancing educational facilities. We invite other donors to join us in creating similar opportunities and fostering an environment that supports and empowers our students.
