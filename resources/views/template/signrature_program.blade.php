The primary objective of this innovative office is to harness the collective potential of NUST's extensive network to secure vital resources and funding. Since its inception, the Resource Mobilization Office has successfully assembled a team of five dedicated Resource Mobilization Officers (RMOs), who have played a pivotal role in expanding our outreach and establishing a strong presence in their respective regions. Through their tireless efforts, we have been able to broaden our donor base, cultivate strategic partnerships, and secure essential support for our academic and research initiatives. We would like to acknowledge our RMOs on our catalog :</p>
